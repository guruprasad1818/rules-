-> Write Python code 
  
  ->Script Mode (100%)

     -> using code editor

  -> comand Line / Interactive Mode (Quick checks)


      -> Directly execuiting code on python Interpreter using 
         CLI (comand line interface)

  -> Syntex - Rules and guidlines

  -> print(hello world) -- issue
  -> print(9) -- no issue

-> 9 is literal number, it doesn't need to be defined before hand
->hello world is a text,which needs to be represented in single or double quotes
        
        -> print (hello world) wrong Syntex
        -> print ('hello worl') correct Syntex

-> Like English has 26 alphabates, whih needs is basis for forming words and sentences
-> python has same concept,which are called as key words
  
   ->keywords + Syntex = program / app

-> import is a keywords --> imports module --> module is a.py file
