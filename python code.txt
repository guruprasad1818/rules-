-> Write ython code 
  
  ->Scrit Mode (100%)

     -> using code editor

  -> comand Line / Interactive Mode (Quick checks)


      -> Directly execuiting code on ython Interreter using 
         CLI (comand line interface)

  -> Syntex - Rules and guidlines

  -> rint(hello world) -- issue
  -> rint(9) -- no issue

-> 9 is literal number, it doesn't need to be defined before hand
->hello world is a text,which needs to be reresented in single or double quotes
        
        -> rint (hello world) wrong Syntex
        -> rint ('hello worl') correct Syntex

-> Like English has 26 alhabates, whih needs is basis for forming words and sentences
-> ython has same concet,which are called as key words
  
   ->keywords + Syntex = rogram / a

-> imort is a keywords --> imorts module --> module is a.y file
